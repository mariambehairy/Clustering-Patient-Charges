# Clustering-Patient-Charges

* The dataset will be used to cluster patients, based on similarities in their demographic
and lifestyle factors, specifically focusing on sex, smoker status, and charges.
* Tested clustering tendency using the Hopkins statistic, determined optimal cluster
numbers with the elbow method, and applied K-Medoid and DBSCAN clustering
algorithms.
* Visualized results, evaluated clustering quality with silhouette coefficient
and recall, and identified the best algorithm for the dataset based on these metrics.
